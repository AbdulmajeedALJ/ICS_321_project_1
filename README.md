# Node.js Backend Template

This repository provides a basic Node.js backend boilerplate to help you quickly get started with a RESTful API server. It's structured with separation of concerns in mind, making it easier to scale and maintain.

## Features

- Express.js server
- Route, controller, and middleware separation
- Environment variable management with `.env`
- MongoDB connection template using Mongoose (commented for setup)
- Basic error handling and process stability logic

├── middleware        # Custom Express middleware (e.g., error handling)
├── models            # Database schemas (e.g., Mongoose models)
├── routes            # API route definitions
├── app.js            # Express app configuration
├── server.js         # Entry point to start the server

├── .gitignore        # Files/folders to ignore in Git

└── package-lock.json # Locked dependency versions
```

## Getting Started

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Configure environment variables

Create a `.env` file (based on `config.env`) to store values like:

```
PORT=3000
DATABASE=<your_database_url>
DATABASE_PASSWORD=<your_db_password>
```

### 3. Run the server

```bash
node server.js
```

### 4. About `server.js`

This file serves as the main entry point of the application. It:

- Loads environment variables from `config.env` using `dotenv`.
- Imports the Express app from `app.js`.
- (Commented) Includes a sample MongoDB connection using `mongoose` with password injection.
- Starts the server on the port specified in the `.env` file.
- Handles unhandled promise rejections globally to prevent the server from crashing silently.
